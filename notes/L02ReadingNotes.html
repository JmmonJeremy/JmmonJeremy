            >: This approach advocates creating small objects that describe
            single tasks or behaviors and using them as the building blocks for
            more complex objects. It sees objects as building blocks that go
            together to make other objects rather than classes that are
            monolithic structures layered on top of each other. This design
            pattern seeks to solve the following problems (The problem Joe
            Armstrong describes is that if an object requires a banana() method
            that belongs to the Gorilla class, you have to inherit the whole
            class to gain access to that method. But as well as the method you
            wanted, the object also inherits a lot of other properties and
            methods that are not needed, causing it to become unnecessarily
            bloated.)</span

        When creating classes is to keep inheritance chains short. A good rule

        two objects makes unpicking any issues far easier.
        <strong><u>#3</u></strong> If you want to use a particular method from a
        class, but it has lots of properties and methods you don&apos;t need,
        then it would be preferable to just &apos;borrow&apos; the method
        instead. <strong><u>#4</u></strong> An even better approach would be to
        move the banana() method into a separate object then add it as a mixin

          specific pieces of information about the application, as well as any
          other associated logic and behavior.) #2 Views (provide a visual
          representation of the model showing all the relevant information and
          provide a way for users to interact with an application, usually via
          forms. In a web application, this would be the HTML displayed on a web
          page.) #3 Controllers (link models and views together by communicating
          between them. They respond to events, which are usually inputs from a
          user (entering some data into a form, for example), process the
          information, then update the model and view accordingly.) Many
          frameworks have emerged that take care of much of the setup code for
