<p class= "calibri2" id="center-it"><strong><span class= "romans">Working With Groups (Notes)</span></strong></p>
<p class= "calibri"><span class= "romans">Good communication is the key to success.</span></p>
<p class= "calibri"><span class= "romans">Good tools to use: #1 Slack or Teams #2 Trello #3 GitHub</span></p>

<p class= "calibri"><span class= "romans">Development workflow for Wed development has become quite complicated so there are tools in 3 categories to help manage it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class= "calibri"><span class= "romans">#1 Package managers (We&rsquo;re using &ldquo;npm&rdquo;)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class= "calibri"><span class= "romans">#2 Bundlers (We&rsquo;re using &ldquo;Snowpack&rdquo; others include: &ldquo;Parcel&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;Webpack&rdquo;)</span></p>
<p class= "calibri"><span class= "romans">#3 Task managers (We&rsquo;re using &ldquo;npm&rdquo; others include: &ldquo;Grunt&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;Gulp&rdquo;)</span></p>
<p class= "calibri"><span class= "romans">We will be using a &ldquo;NPM/Node-based workflow for this course this semester.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class= "calibri"><span class= "romans">Version Control: a method of recording changes made to a file or set of files that allows you to come back to a specific version if desired.</span></p>
<p class= "calibri"><span class= "romans">Types of version control: #1 Centralized (Code is on central server)#2 Distributed (ex &ldquo;Git&rdquo;; Copy of code is distributed to programmers to work on privately before uploading)</span></p>
<p class= "calibri"><span class= "romans">Git: Distributed version control system that runs on the terminal &amp; keeps track of modification of files in a local repository on your computer</span></p>
<p class= "calibri"><span class= "romans">- developed by Linus Torvald (who developed OS, Linux)</span></p>
<p class= "calibri"><span class= "romans">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Practical Uses</span></p>
<p class= "calibri"><span class= "romans">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;#1 Keep copies of all versions in case you need to switch back to one</span></p>
<p class= "romans5"><span class= "romans">#2 Show potential employers code samples</span></p>
<p class= "romans5"><span class= "romans">#3 Showcase work to potential customers</span></p>
<p class= "romans5"><span class= "romans">#4 Collaborate with other developers</span></p>
<p class= "romans5"><span class= "romans">#5 Keep myself updated on trending repositories</span></p>

    <li><span class= "romans3">to avoid <strong><u>mistakes</u></strong> (git diff filename) to display the differences between the working file and the git repository&rsquo;s previous version</span></li>
    <li><span class= "romans3">to <strong><u>get updates from teammates changes etc</u></strong> from github repository (git fetch) &amp; then (git merge origin/master) <strong>or</strong> just (git pull origin master)</span></li>

    <li><strong><u><span class= "f-size">general good practice for git pushes</span></u></strong><strong><span class= "romans3">:</span></strong><span class= "romans3">&nbsp;to pull any work before you push your latest changes to git, which avoids failed or rejected push requests to github</span></li>
    <li><span class= "romans3">if <strong><u>pull request is rejected because of a conflicting change made to same part by you &amp; teammate:</u></strong> 1<sup>st</sup> discuss and decide on which change to keep and erase the other &amp; then (git add . or filename) &amp; then (git commit -m &ldquo;commit message&rdquo;) &amp; then (git push origin master)</span></li>
    <li><span class= "romans3">3 file states in Git #1 &ldquo;Modified&rdquo; (current state of a file you&rsquo;re still working on in your folder) #2 &ldquo;Staged&rdquo; (file you added to staging area of Git to take snapshot of * like a photo booth) #3 &ldquo;Committed&rdquo; (Git has taken a snapshot of the current state &amp; are stored in the repo now)</span></li>
    <li><span class= "romans3">3 sections of a Git project (A folder with all your code files that has been initialized with Git) #1 &ldquo;Working Directory&rdquo; (modified files) #2 &ldquo;Staging Area&rdquo; (staged files) #3 &ldquo;Repository&rdquo; (committed files)</span></li>
    <li><span class= "romans3">Git basic syntax #1 &ldquo;git add&rdquo; (adds file to the staging area) #2 &ldquo;git commit&rdquo; (takes a snapshot of the current state of your file &amp; puts it in the repository) #3 &ldquo;git push</span></li>
    <li><span class= "romans3">Git basic workflow (sequence of steps to complete a task) #1 Modifying files in the working directory, then &ldquo;git add&rdquo; = #2 adding files to the staging area, the &ldquo;git commit&rdquo; = #3 committing files to the repository, then &ldquo;git push&rdquo; = uploading to the repository</span></li>
    <li><span class= "romans3">Blue + sign under commits = space teammates can leave comments about commits in github</span></li>
</ul>
<p class= "calibri"><span class= "romans">GitHub: Code sharing and publishing service that has a collection of repositories from other developers. &ndash; it has #1 clone, #2 pull requests, &amp; #3 fork features</span></p>
<p class= "calibri"><span class= "romans">Git Branches Purpose: to provide a separate environment where you can experiment &ndash; such as adding or deleting features using the same git add git commit process. The code base on the master branch remains untouched. A branch by default contains all the code that is on the master. It is essentially a copy until you start making changes on that specific git branch.</span></p>
<p class= "calibri"><span class= "romans">Head: refers to the tip of the branch you are on (the most recent commit on that branch). It points to the most recent &ldquo;snap shot&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p class= "calibri"><span class= "romans">Branches Git commands: <strong>(git branch -a) lists all branches</strong>, *denotes which branch you are on (git branch name) creates a branch (git checkout name) to move to a branch or for 2 in one (git checkout -b name) to create and move to a branch in one command ( git branch -m name of branch to rename followed by new name) to rename a branch (git branch -d name) to delete a branch, you can&rsquo;t be on a branch you are deleting | after switching to a branch with (git checkout name) make changes to file locally &amp; then (git add .) to make a copy of all files to the branch &amp; then (git commit -m &ldquo;commit message&rdquo;) &amp; then (git push origin branch name) to load to github <strong>(git checkout -t origin/&ldquo;remote_branch_name&rdquo;) to bring download branch from GitHub</strong>.</span></p>
<p class= "calibri"><span class= "romans">Branches changes conflict: (git add filename) &amp; then (git commit -m &ldquo;commit message&rdquo;) &amp; then (git pull origin branch name) &amp; then discuss which change to keep with teammate &amp; make final changes &amp; then (git add filename) &amp; then (git commit -m &ldquo;commit message&rdquo;) &amp; then (git push origin branch name)</span></p>
<p class= "calibri"><span class= "romans">Merging branches: (assuming no commit changes have happened to the main branch for #1 &amp; #2) <strong>#1</strong> fast forward merge = Head points to latest commit on the branch &nbsp; <strong>#2</strong> No fast forward merge &ldquo;--no-ff &rdquo; a separate merge commit represents the merge <strong>#3</strong> 3 way merge 2 commits are generated for the two branches and then they are merged and another merge commit is generated. This happens when development is occurring on both branches simultaneously | The merge type is usually determined by an algorithm except for the &ldquo;--no-ff &ldquo; where you enter (git merge --no-ff branch name)</span></p>
<p class= "calibri"><span class= "romans">Deleting branches: (git branch -d branch name) to delete it locally &amp; then (git push origin &ndash;delete branch name)</span></p>
<p class= "calibri"><span class= "romans">Git Rebase: Moves a branch up to a new base commit, integrates changes from one branch to another. (git merge &ndash; creates a merge commit to represent the integration of one branch into another) rebase rebases the branch you are currently on to the base branch. It creates a linear history rewriting the history. It is not considered good practice to us rebase on repositories being shared with others.</span></p>
<p class= "calibri"><span class= "romans">Viewing Commit History: #1 (git log) #2 (git log --pretty=oneline) #3 (git log &ndash;author=github username) #4 (git log --graph --decorate --oneline) #5 (git log -n then number to limit by) #6 (git show commit number) shows what changed where in the file for that commit #7 (git diff branch 1 name branch 2 name) shows the differences between the two branches</span></p>
<p class= "calibri"><span class= "romans">GitHub Pages: URL for project page = username.github.io/RepoName 1<sup>st</sup> (git checkout -b gh-pages) 2<sup>nd</sup> (git push origin gh-pages)</span><span class= "roboto">&nbsp;Any change you commit to gh-pages branch is picked up by github to build your github pages.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class= "calibri"><span class= "romans">Git Clone: 1<sup>st</sup> click on the green code button in the repository. 2<sup>nd</sup> copy the URL from the drop down that comes 3<sup>rd</sup> change to the directory you want the folder in 4<sup>th</sup> (git clone GitHub repository URL)</span></p>
<p class= "calibri"><span class= "romans">Git Fork: 1<sup>st</sup> Click the fork button in the Repository 2<sup>nd</sup> Clone to your computer for a local copy</span></p>
<p class= "calibri"><span class= "romans">GitHub Pull Request: Allows you to propose changes to someone else&rsquo;s project. The owner of the original repository is notified. They can review the code and accept it and merge it or reject the proposed changes. 1<sup>st</sup> Click the Pull Request button 2<sup>nd</sup> Click on Labels button and select a category 3<sup>rd</sup> Click on Milestones to help categorize your pull request 4<sup>th</sup> Click on create pull request</span></p>
<p class= "calibri"><span class= "romans">SSH: Secure Shell (ssh-keygen -t rsa -C email address associated with GitHub) &amp; then enter &amp; confirm a passphrase &amp; then (eval &ldquo;$(ssh-agent -s)&rdquo;) &amp; then (ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa) &amp; then type in the passphrase from earlier copy &amp; then Open your .pub file and copy the key &amp; then Click on settings in your GitHub account &amp; then Click on SSH keys &amp; then Click on Add SSH key &amp; then paste the contents of the .pub file &amp; then Add Title &ldquo;Adding Public Key&rdquo; &amp; then Click on Add key button</span></p>
<p class= "calibri"><strong><span class= "romans">Comparing 2 commits</span></strong><span class= "romans">: add /compare(then commit number)..(then commit number) after the browser while in the repository.</span></p>
<p class= "calibri"><strong><span class= "romans">To pull down a teammates branch for testing</span></strong><span class= "romans">: git checkout -t origin/remote branch name&nbsp;</span></p>
