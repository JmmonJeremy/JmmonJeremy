        (With little guidance student is able to generate project ideas to apply their knowledge

       <div class="subheader_endcap"></div>
       <p>I was always trying to use my creativity to add a little bit more to the parts of the 
           SleepOutside website that I worked on because of my curiosity about how I might be able 
           to make things a little bit better. 
        </p>
        <h2><u>Example #1</u></h2>
        <p>I am most proud of was the card with the Duplicate items in cart feature. After a lot of work 
            and effort I came up with a creative solution to this of giving the product objects a new 
            category to keep track of their quantity within the object.
        </p>
        <h2><u>Example #2</u></h2>
        <p>If you look at the work I did I was always looking for ways to be creative and make things a 
            little bit better and I would often find myself accidentally working on parts of or doing 
            another card without realizing it. An example of this is when I did with the (cart.html error 
            with empty cart card) as a result of working on the (Add item to cart broken card)             
        </p>
        <h2><u>Example #3</u></h2>
        <p>Another example where I ended up doing another card accidentally from being creative and trying 
            to make things a little better is when I did the (Duplicate items in cart card) as a result of 
            working on the (Remove from cart feature card)
        </p>
        <h2><u>Example #4</u></h2>
        <p>An example of generating project ideas to apply my knowledge and improve my skills from the 
            final project is how I asked the question "what if we could helf refine a user's search for
            a book?" I then applied my knowledge and worked on improving my skills by making this happen 
            for our group project.
        </p>
        <h2><u>Example #5</u></h2>
        <p>The last example I would like to share of generating a project idea by asking "what if" and 
            applying my knowledge was putting together this portfolio. I tried to go the extra mile by 
            putting together a creative and nice website based portfolio that was all linked together.
