        <hr class="qp">
        <p class="qp">(Student is an active participant in the team activities. Student watches for 
            opportunities to help their peers, and feels satisfaction when they are able to successfully 
            help someone.)
        </p> 
       <div class="subheader_endcap"></div>
       <p> I have always enjoyed helping others and appreciate being able to learn from others. I look 
           for oportunites where I might be able to help someone and try to do what I can to be of 
           service. I also recognize that most people know something that I don't that they can teach me. 
           I had the opportunity to both serve and learn from others during my time in this class.
        </p>
        <h2><u>Example #1</u></h2>
        <p> The first example of this for me of helping others was the first team activity when we first 
            started. I set up all the tools and kept reaching out to my team members until everyone was 
            set up and coming to the group meetings.  
        </p>
        <h2><u>Example #2</u></h2>
        <p>The second example of me helping others is when I saw that Cherelle needed help and was looking 
            for a team, so I reached out to her. She was thankful and joined our group. She has been a good 
            addition to our group and she keeps telling McKay and I have been an answer to her prayers. It 
            feels good to have been able to be of help to her.                     
        </p>
        <h2><u>Example #3</u></h2>
        <p>The third example of me both helping others and learning from others is that I have met with our 
            team at least twice a week every week, sometimes more. We went through the code together and 
            learned from each other.
