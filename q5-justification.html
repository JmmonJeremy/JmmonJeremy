        <hr class="qp">
        <p class="qp">(Student writes code that is free from syntax and logical errors. Student is adept with 
            the developer tools built into each browser. (Breakpoints, stepping through and inspecting code, 
            using the element/css inspector, console, etc...) Student is able to successfully set up try/catch 
            blocks in their code to handle potential runtime errors.)            
        </p> 
       <div class="subheader_endcap"></div>
       <p> I always work to get my code clean and run tests on it to make sure it is good. I like to use browser 
           development tools to help with that. I think I was okay at debugging before taking this class, but I 
           have had a lot of practice now at debugging. I use console.log, breakpoints and try catch blocks to 
           help resolve issues that come up. I have also learned it is good to do a little bit of coding and 
           then check it along te way as you go, instead of doing a whole bunch and the finding an error and 
           having to go back through a bunch of changes to find the issue.  
        </p>
        <h2><u>Example #1</u></h2>
        <p> The first example I have of using debugging tools is a new tool that I have discovered in Google 
            development tools. There is a button that looks like a stop sign in the upper right-hand corner that 
            if you click it puts pauses on exceptions in the code. That is a very handy tool, it automatically 
            stops the code in the area the problem is occuring.  
        </p>
        <h2><u>Example #2</u></h2>
        <p>The second example of me troubleshooting bugs is in the admin feature that we worked on. Our team used 
            try/catch blocks and console.log statements to find and stop bad orders from coming into our order list. 
            I ended up sending the error messages to the top of the screen so we would know how many orders were 
            faulty and why.
