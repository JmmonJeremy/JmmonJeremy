        <p class="qp">(Student spends adequate time in planning their projects before they start coding.
            Student is adept in taking a complex problem and breaking it down into small trivial steps.)            
        </p> 
       <div class="subheader_endcap"></div>
       <p> Like many other things in life, programming can be overwhelming. I think the only way to really be 
           successful at in overcoming complex problems is to take things one small step at a time. The way our 
           SleepOutsite task cards were broken up into small pieces is a good example of that and I followed 
           that pattern in takling the different coding problems that I faced. 
        </p>
        <h2><u>Example #1</u></h2>
        <p> The first example of me breaking a big problem down into little steps was how learned to make 
            templates and take small pieces of a web page that can be placed in the overall page and reused 
            in small bits. I used that principle as I worked on the (Team8Authentication card) individually 
            to get it done before we met as a team. Everything that needed to be done in the card became 
            overwhelming, so I broke things down and did one step at a time, including making a template for 
            the list of orders that was sent back to display on the admin page.   
        </p>
        <h2><u>Example #2</u></h2>
        <p>The second example of me making plans and breaking things down into small steps comes from the Product 
            Comments feature. I broke the process of building that feature down into one step at a time and it 
            came together nicely. First I created a comments button with HTML on the product details page, because 
            I had to have a button to start the process. I then added a method that added the comment input to 
            the page when the comment button was pushed. I then made three buttons within the comment field: 
            delete (which removed the input field), clear (which cleared the comment input field), and post 
            (which posted the comments to the page). I then worked on making each button do the function it was 
            intended for one at a time. In the end I had a nice comments feature.
