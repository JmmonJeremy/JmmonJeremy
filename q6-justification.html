       <p>Throughout the course of this class I have applied myself with everything that I have. I have strived to soak 
           up as much information as I can. I have read, studied, taken thorough notes, and practiced and applied what 
           I have learned. I put a ton of effort into the SleepOutside project and the CloudShelf final group proeject. 
           As a result I have gained all of the skills discussed in the question above. I am by no means an expert in 
           all of these skills, but I have become fairly proficient in these skills.
        </p>
        <h2><u>Example #1 & #2</u></h2>
        <p> I think that my work in both the SleepOutside project and the CloudShelf final group project more than 
            prove that I am able to successfully build a dynamic web application using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. I 
            applied mobile application design to our CloudShelf project, trying to build from the small version out. 
            I manipulated the DOM with Javascript in tons of way in the CloudShelf group project and in the SleepOutside 
            Project. I effectively used event listeners with JavaScript to handle user events of button clicks in 
            both the SleepOutside project and the CloudShelf group project. I pulled data from an external source - 
            the file for the SleepOutside project and Google Books API for the CloudShelf group project that was used 
            to populate the important data for each site. I seperated and organized my code using objects, classes, modules, 
            and keeping related areas of functionality together. Finally I used CSS transition, transform, and display none 
            to animate the application with movement and modal pop-ups.
