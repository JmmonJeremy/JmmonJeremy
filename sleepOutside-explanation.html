        <p>I worked on several aspects of the SleepOutside Project. Here is a list of addtional 
            features outside of the team assigned cards that I completed for the site.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add discount to product detail pages</li>
            <li>Add item to cart broken</li>
            <li>Animate cart (backpack) icon when item added to cart</li>
            <li>cart.html error with empty cart</li>
            <li>Discount flag on product detail</li>
            <li>Discount indicator-product listing</li>
            <li>Duplicate items in cart</li>
            <li>Product Comments</li>
            <li>Quick lookup</li>
            <li>Remove from cart feature</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="emphasized">SleepOutside Solution</h2>
        <p>GitHub Pages does not allow http requests and gives an error. I came up with a work
            around to be able to run our site through GitHub pages. I found the solution by 
            searching for answers on the internet. (Just another example of me being able to bridge 
            the gap of knowledge by finding other resources.) 
        </p>
        <p>In order to be able to run our the sleepOutside website through our GitHub pages you have 
            to open the console and when you click on a product an error will show with the following 
            website listed: 
            "https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/
            http://157.201.228.93:2992/products/search/
            sleeping-bags" 
            or whatever product type you clicked on for the ending (tents, hammocks, backpacks). If you 
            go to that site it will show a button to click for temporary permission. After you click on 
            that it will allow you to run the site - pretty much like normal.
        </p>
        <p>There is a glitch to be aware of. If you click on all four product type going back and forth 
            it will sometimes link to the incorrect product. I have had to do a hard reset and eventually I can 
            get to each product with the links. I think because it is being transferred through this other site to 
            become a https request it is the correct product link is getting lost sometimes and the one that was there 
            before stays with it. That's a little annoying, but at least you can pretty much run and test the 
            functionality of our sit and work with this work around.
