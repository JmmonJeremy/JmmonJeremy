        <p class="qp"><b>2. becoming more dexterous at exploring your environment</b></p>
        <hr class="qp">
        <p class="qp">(Student is adept at finding other resources to fill gaps that they 
            recognize in their knowledge of the subject area. Student successfully finds the 
            answers to their 'what if?' questions.)
        </p> 
       <div class="subheader_endcap"></div>
       <p>It has become second nature for me to search for answers when I run into a coding 
           issue that I don't know the answer to. I am also building a huge library of resources 
           to reference to help me remember answers and solutions to coding problems. Whenever I came 
           across something I wasn't sure how to do for a SleepOutside Trello Board 
           assignment card or for a feature on the CloudShelf final group project I looked to find 
           the solutions on the internet, in files I've saved on my browser, or in the thorough notes 
           I took from our reading.
        </p>
        <h2><u>Example #1</u></h2>
        <p> The first example of me finding other resources to fill in gaps of knowledge in how to do 
            a particular coding task is the resources I have built for myself with my thorough note 
            taking. In addition to having these notes in a searchable word document, I took the initiative 
            to convert the notes into web pages that I can easily reference now as well. 
        </p>
        <h2><u>Example #2</u></h2>
        <p>The second example of me finding other resources to overcome the obstacle of gaps in my 
            knowledge of how to accomplish a coding task are the files of information I have started 
            to accumulate in my browser. I have a ton of references now and I am continuing to organize 
            the information to make it as easily accessible as possible.                    
        </p>
        <h2><u>Example #3</u></h2>
        <p>The third example of me finding other resources when asking the "what if" questions is how 
            I use the internet as a resource to find answers to my questions. A good example of this in 
            my work was the (Quick lookup card) that I did. It asked me to do a modal pop-up from a quick 
            view button. I had no idea how to do that when I started. So, I did a search on the internet, 
            found examples, one which I attached to the card to model my work after and used a w3schools 
            tutorial to learn how to do it. With that resource of help that I found; I was able to 
            successfully complete the task.
